/**
 * Render tiers for the ecosystem explorer.
 *
 * The city is a genuinely heavy scene — a 4K shadow map, bloom, SMAA and a few
 * thousand instanced props — and it used to render at full weight on every
 * device that could get a WebGL context. That is fine on a desktop GPU and
 * miserable on a mid-range phone, with no way out.
 *
 * So: three tiers plus a way to switch the canvas off entirely. `auto` picks a
 * tier from what the device will admit to; an explicit choice is remembered.
 * Every knob that costs real frame time lives here, so there is one place to
 * look when the scene needs to get cheaper.
